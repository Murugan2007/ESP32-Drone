# ESP32-Drone
A Drone made using ESP32 V1 That can hold altitude, has complementary PID Stabilization, controlled via wifi and has a range of 20 Metres Which you can actually improve using ESP-NOW or LoRA

The initial version was heavier for these tiny 716 motors which had L9110S motor driver

the drone itself isn't stable and I'll not recommend you making it from scratch, just do it as a side hustle if you have all the parts

the newer version has a motor driver made with si2300 MOSFET which you can take references from Max Imaginations YouTube channel 

Checkout more on datasheets available in Arduino community and important point of all is to keep the weight bare minimum (>35g)
